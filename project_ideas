1.) Very interested in learning computational principles in network medicine. Perhaps I could look into project ideas for biological network construction; how to organize, clean, and
    apply visualizations on multi-omics databases; some form of topological analysis?; continue honing machine learning models, specifically within the realm of prediction models.
