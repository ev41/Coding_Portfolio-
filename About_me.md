# Coding_Portfolio-

My interest in data analytics began in 2017 as I was developing several online businesses. The first time I faced data-driven decision-making was through Facebook Business Manager, where I had to make sense out of my advertising and marketing data and make necessary adjustments to ad campaigns. This experience planted a seed, which I revisted years later via a master's degree (2021-2022) in data analytics.

Part of what I enjoyed most was using this data to learn about my customers. Who was purchasing my product(s)? Why was a particular demographic interested in my product(s)? Why were some folks NOT interested enough to purchase? How could I tweak my product, or the story I tell with it, to better suit their needs? I grew to love data for the stories I can tell with it, and how I could use these stories to supplement product & business development, and as a result, customer satisfaction.

Facebook Business Manager is where my interest in data began, but since then I have taken on different projects to diversify my skillset. For instance, I've launched functional coding projects (i.e. crypto_bot), as well as for-fun projects (i.e. spotify_song_recommendations). I have a passion for using programming as a way to better understand the softwares, apps, or tools that I interact with on a regular basis. There's a certain comfort in knowing the ins and outs of how something works, and coding is one catalyst for this.
