Here is a spotify song recommendation tool I created. This project accesses the public spotify API and uses API functions to 
create a playlist bases on any song provided by the user interacting with the algorithm.

rec_tool2.py is the most recent ~functioning~ version. rec_tool3.py is an incomplete attempt to optimize the previous iteration.
